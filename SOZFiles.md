![SOZ - Main objectives ](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104008465/164983461-c2d93179-9df2-464b-934c-4c3903a87451.png)
The main goal of SOZ development is to **revamp the various primary mechanics used by players.** This desire to improve the landscape has pushed us to review **the ergonomics of several interactions with a point of honor**, even going so far as to review the primary interactions such as the exchange between players, the use of chests, parking lots, and many other things.

In order to make this dream come true, we had to force ourselves to **develop everything we could from scratch**, while making less use of what already exists for free, developed by a ton of developers with the goal of helping the community. **Allowing us to ignore all paid resources.**

The other goal of SOZ is to **offer a "Click & Host Server"**, but in all honesty, this is very difficult and our V1 will not allow this. **However, we will force ourselves to improve this until we can really offer this to you.**

Also, we count on the participation of the community. **We may not be the best, but together we can be.** Providing quality development that can improve all of our servers should be the primary goal of any developer with a community. **By creating SOZ, we want to allow any developer to take what we have developed and improve your respective servers.** At the same time helping SOZ to grow in order to contribute to the war effort.

![SOZ - Key Feature ](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104008465/164982666-ec501b93-94db-4773-83a4-0f8f0a96e7c5.png)
**Exhaustive list of what SOZ offers:**
> Use of a QB base that will disappear in V2.

> Twelve different companies, with their own gameplay mechanics. Each of them having a dependence on another one in order to create open circuits of RÃ´lePlay. (Example: Gas stations are emptied to force to be used, as well as banks and ATM. Asking Players to fill these. )

> BTarget improvement, allowing to add any interaction.

> Use of safes simultaneously, all separate.

> A custom VOIP Mumble.

> Multiple vehicle exits for parking, garages and companies.

> Drag & Drop inventory to improve usability.

> A modern phone, with its applications.

> Free mappings created by our team, as well as map modifications added.

> A hundred of apartments, all ready to use.

* Special note : Somes mapping are actually delete from the OpenSource because they're not as our own propriety. They will be replace asap.
